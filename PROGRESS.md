# PROGRESS — Grand Theft Freeway-BX

The implementation tracker for [`PLAN.md`](PLAN.md). Update it as work lands: tick tasks, fill the
Definition of Done evidence, log decisions and open issues. Keep "Now" current — it is what a
resumed or compacted session reads first.

## Now
- **Phase:** M2 City in progress (2026-10-17). Landed: E14 world regions (`b5de689`); `pav_world`
  + Paloma Bay + far view (`d905d41`); Mirador Hills terrain, reference views (`a24dbb6`); Route 404
  with the Pretzel and Harbor Gate ramps and the broken end (`db8772e`); The Ditch (`6c0ed5e`).
  In progress (uncommitted): lane graph, signals, parking, walk tiles, cover (`pav_world::lanes`,
  `walk`, `cover`), `[[jump]]`/`[[sign]]` placements, the Proving Grounds (`dev_district.toml`),
  time of day + weather (`gtf_game::daytime`, `content/freeway/world.toml`), the streaming tour
  (`freeway/tour` + `tests/streaming.rs`), `gtf citymap` and `gtf perf`. Helpers running in
  worktrees: E7 renderer (sky, weather visuals, window kernel, night emissives, culling, shadow
  follow, render-style fields on `ViewIntent`) and the `LIB/gtf_city` props + `MAT/gtf` materials.
  Next: merge both, tune the presets with the sky, captures of all views at three times of day,
  web build into the city, then M3 (player + vehicles, E9).
- **Branch / PR:** the session's designated branch; the draft PR opened with the plan.

## Milestones (PLAN.md §9 has the full task lists and acceptance criteria)
- [x] **M0 Bootstrap** — engine vendored; baseline tests; E1 registry, `pav_tools::cli`, `pav_app`
      lib split, `gtf_game` + `gtf_app`; `freeway` scene in every target; web boot check.
- [x] **M1 Platform** — E2 input v2, E3 hook v2, E4 presentation data, E5 `pav_ui` + headless HUD
      capture, E6 camera intent + draw list, E13 app shell, E8 part 1 (bank + loops), UI gallery,
      FPS readout.
- [ ] **M2 City** — E14 world regions first (region provider, static meshes, speed-aware streaming,
      far LOD, unload policies); `pav_world` generator + graphs; city props/materials; E7 sky, time of
      day + weather, window kernel, CPU region culling, merged statics; district + dev district +
      views; `citymap`, `lanes`, `perf`.
- [ ] **M3 Player and vehicles** — on-foot controller, camera modes, E9 vehicles v2 (pitch/roll
      freed with stabilization), enter/exit, carjack, damage, helicopter, vehicle audio, GPS ribbon,
      radio skeleton, `vehicle_feel` incl. slopes and jumps.
- [ ] **M4 Population** — traffic, pedestrians, population manager, LOD, buses, parked cars,
      ambience, soaks.
- [ ] **M5 Combat and heat** — weapons, cover, vitals, enemy AI, wanted system, police AI, air unit,
      busted/wasted.
- [ ] **M6 Structure** — mission DSL + runtime + bots, protagonists + switching + abilities, phone,
      economy and shops, save/load.
- [ ] **M7 Content** — final district, landmarks, interiors, all vehicles and props, missions m1–m3,
      s1–s3, h0, h1 (Loud + Smart), activities, radio stations, completion.
- [ ] **M8 Frontend and attract** — title, menus, settings, About, loading cards, attract director,
      touch = attract only.
- [ ] **M9 Polish** — art, animation, audio mix, UX against the 10-foot rules, accessibility,
      performance, bug bash.
- [ ] **M10 Release** — builds (native, Windows `.exe`, `dist/GrandTheftFreeway-BX.html`), docs,
      final verification, delivery.

## Decisions
- 2026-10-17 — **Name:** *Grand Theft Freeway-BX* (title #25 of 50 drawn with `secrets.randbelow`,
  ID "BX" from `secrets.choice` over A–Z0–9; PLAN.md §3).
- 2026-10-17 — **Engine in the repo as a vendored copy** of upstream `0098196` minus
  `pavilion-lite/` (not a submodule or subtree), paths unchanged so engine scripts and tests work;
  engine README/CLAUDE moved to `docs/ENGINE_*.md`; pin recorded in `docs/ENGINE_UPSTREAM.md`.
- 2026-10-17 — **Game in its own crates** (`gtf_game` sim-only, `gtf_app` binaries) registered at
  runtime (E1), so game edits don't rebuild `pav_tools`/`pav_app`.
- 2026-10-17 — **Presentation as data** through the hook (E4): UI model, draw list, camera intent,
  view intent, audio scene, app requests; engine crates draw and play them.
- 2026-10-17 — **Sim-side camera** (deterministic, visible to captures and bots); the view only
  interpolates and adds cosmetic shake.
- 2026-10-17 — **UI on egui** through a new `pav_ui` 10-foot kit with headless capture (works native
  and web; HTML/CSS UI would be web-only).
- 2026-10-17 — **New engine crates** `pav_ui` and `pav_world` (urban open-world kit) instead of
  growing `pav_core` or putting reusable city systems in the game crate.
- 2026-10-17 — **Model identifiers stay out of repository files** (environment rule); README, About
  screen and HTML give the lab and effort levels and point to the chat report for the exact model.
- 2026-10-17 — **Rewind** is a dev tool: off in release, web and touch builds, ~10 s in dev tools.
- 2026-10-17 — **Planning review applied.** An independent review raised 27 findings; the key ones
  were verified in the engine source and folded into PLAN.md: E14 (game scenes run with streaming
  off, streaming is hard-wired to the pavilion, the view draws only loaded regions), E9 frees vehicle
  pitch/roll (cars are locked to yaw today), a character LOD mode, CPU region culling into the
  global batches instead of per-region buffers, the `docs_limits.rs` caps (MAKE_A_GAME.md < 16 KiB),
  prop publish `pack=` and `gtf` material embedding, game tools through `pav_tools::cli::main_with`,
  `until:` polling for browser checks, D16 (developer demo level), and touch devices showing only
  the gear button.

- 2026-10-17 — **Paloma Bay is 64 × 72 cells** (1024 × 1152 m): 8 extra rows of hills to the north
  give Mirador Drive, Lookout Drive and the PALOMA sign room (the plan's sketch had 5 rows).
- 2026-10-17 — **Terrain is a painted height grid** beside the map (one character per cell, 4 m
  steps) smoothed into 4 m samples; flat cells stay slabs so the city keeps sidewalks and markings.
  Hill roads are grid streets flattened across (switchbacks of straight runs), not splines.
- 2026-10-17 — **Route 404** is a swept deck (30.4 m, three lanes each way) at 11 m; ramps land
  on one-cell stubs off the cross streets (no frontage roads, so nothing drives under a low ramp);
  the corridor's ground sits at road level (`level = -0.15`).
- 2026-10-17 — **The Ditch** keeps the channel as its own road network (road roles never join
  channel and street cells); crossing roads keep their own characters and become bridges.
- 2026-10-17 — **Walking is a 2 m tile map** (sidewalk, crossing tied to its junction's signal,
  path, open ground) instead of a hand-built node graph: every loop, corner and crosswalk is one
  connected surface, A* over tiles for longer trips. Cover points come from building walls facing
  walkable tiles, the Ditch's walls and the freeway barriers.
- 2026-10-17 — **Game cameras get no cutaway** (walls are not cut or faded when a hook game
  supplies `PlayFrame.camera`).

## Open issues
- None yet. (Planning-time unknowns to verify early: rapier body-type switching for vehicle LOD in
  M4; egui-wgpu offscreen rendering for `capture hud=true` in M1; DualSense button mapping through
  gilrs on the user's Windows machine — a user check.)

## Log
- 2026-10-17 — Planning: engine studied at `0098196`; measured starter bot (3/3 wins), Drift Circuit
  6,886 ticks/s, pavilion world 649 ticks/s with 8,200 instances / 2,025 draw calls / 483k triangles /
  64 lights; single-file web build 3 min 06 s → 11.2 MB, boots in headless Chromium with the egui HUD
  visible; `scripts/vendor-engine.sh` tested on a throwaway clone (1,359 files; starter tests 4/4
  pass in the vendored tree). PLAN.md written.
- 2026-10-17 — Independent plan review (27 findings) verified and applied; `scripts/web-check.mjs`
  gained ordered `until:TEXT:TIMEOUT` steps (tested: a pass and a timeout failure).
- 2026-10-17 — **M0 done.** Engine vendored at `0098196` (`689142b`); engine baseline
  `cargo test --workspace`: 66 suites, 455 passed, 0 failed, 2 ignored. E1 (`9bd019a`): game and
  tool registries, `pav_tools::cli::{Cli, run}`, `pav_app::main_with(AppConfig)`. `gtf_game` +
  `gtf_app` (`2bf7495`): `cargo test -p gtf_game` 2/2 (every `freeway*` scene builds and steps;
  snapshot/rewind/replay exact). `gtf capture` of the lot looked at (`out/m0_lot.png`). Native
  window under Xvfb + lavapipe (`scripts/smoke-gtf.sh 15`): boot complete in 4.2 s, sim 60 tps,
  egui HUD and the lot visible (`out/smoke-gtf/screen.png`). Single-file web build
  (`scripts/build-gtf-web.sh`, 3 min 37 s): `dist/GrandTheftFreeway-BX.html` 11.2 MB (wasm 27.9 MB,
  8.3 MB gzipped); headless Chromium (`web-check.mjs --expect "boot complete" --expect "scene
  'freeway'"`): boots in 0.6 s, scene `freeway`, HUD visible (`out/web-m0/start.png`).
- 2026-10-17 — **M1 done.** E2/E3/E4/E6 (`40772ce`); E8 part 1, E12, E13, E14 (`b5de689`);
  `gtf_game` frontend, orbit camera, weapon wheel, settings, UI gallery (`7686717`); E5 `pav_ui`
  (10-foot kit on egui: Anton + Barlow Semi Condensed under OFL, procedural pad glyphs per device,
  HUD, radar and map from the `MapImage`, screens, moments, weapon wheel, phone, offscreen render)
  wired into `pav_app` (overlay, pointer → `ui.*`, gear, FPS readout) and `capture hud=true`.
  Tests: `cargo test -p pav_core -p pav_world -p pav_ui -p pav_view -p gtf_game` 360 passed,
  `cargo test -p pav_tools --lib --test ui_hud --test asset_errors` 54 passed; clippy clean.
  Captures looked at: `gtf` REPL `load scene=freeway/gallery` + `capture hud=true` at 1920×1080 and
  960×540 (`out/m1/gallery_*.png`: title, menu, map, HUD, cards — legible at both sizes). Native
  window (`scripts/smoke-gtf.sh 25 --scene freeway/roam`, Xvfb + lavapipe): boot complete in
  1.5 s, the FPS readout (software rendering, so red), money, radar with the city map, vitals,
  objective with a keycap glyph, the generated city (`out/smoke-gtf/screen.png`).
